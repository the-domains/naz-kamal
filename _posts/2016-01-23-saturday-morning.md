Another night to go. A vampire's diary. After that, four days off. What to do? Nothin'. Well, my nothing is everything plus plus, in normal people's life. What's that mean? Read on..

I live in the middle of heaven on earth Maldives. Kihavah island. I'm a Night Auditor for Anantara Kihavah Villas. Joined in November 2011\. A bartender, phone operator, night auditor and soon will be joining the finance team as a general cashier. That is 6 years in 4 positions. I feel blessed with my colorful life. I feel bless working for Anantara. 

Kihavah island is very small. More or less 200 meters wide and about the same measure in length. We have less than 100 villas. That is 42 individual over water villas and the rest on the beach. Each has a back side pool. A perfect balance between the beauty of nature, Maldivian cultures and people, and the luxury of the resorts life. Each villa has one butler for all they need. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f0c5740e-4d66-4859-b85b-33871d9e8153.jpg)
